One of the first games that I built, back on 2002 when the only tool I knew for it was a Java Applet.

Good memories and not that bad code.

The tank sprite, background and amazing ending ("game over"), all done by myself on Gimp ( I think... )

Thanks to my friend Giacomelli (http://github.com/giacomelli) for helping me think the game structure and even start the code.

--------

## How to run?
The game run as a Java Applet, nowadays is not that easy find a browser that run Java Applet, thus the best way to run in is use the AppletViewer.
